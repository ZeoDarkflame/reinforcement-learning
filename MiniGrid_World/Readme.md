# MiniGrid-World

Implementing RL algorithms on the [MiniGridWorld](https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid) environment.

Algorithms Implemented: 
 - Q-learning
 - One step SARSA

## Q-learning

The following results were obtained from Q-learning on the Empty Room.  
Rewards per episode V/s number of episodes:
